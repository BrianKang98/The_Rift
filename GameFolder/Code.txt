As you jump out of the plane, it explodes with the rest of your squadron inside. You say a quick prayer before you land on the ground behind several MG nests.

You are pulled out by your squad leader and storm forwards. After 3 hours the beach has been taken with the help of the brave paratroopers behind enemy lands.
