echo 1895 (23) (Robinette) - You wake up on a patch of straw in an abandoned barn. There is a glimmer of light shining through the roof and diffracting off your Colt 1890 revolver. You look around and see a map of Texas hanging proud against the wall, along with two exits at either side of the barn.

echo You are dropped from a plane and parachute behind enemy lines. You hear the roar of anti air guns shooting down planes around you. As you jump out of the plane, it explodes with the rest of your squadron inside. You say a quick prayer before you land on the ground behind several MG nests. You see the rest of the battalion landing in small boats on the beaches and pinned down by a line of Nazi soldiers. An airstrike explodes just in front of you destroying all the bunkers. You lose consciousness.

echo You jump into the boat with the rest of your fellow squad members. As you approach the quiet beach you have a terrible feeling about all this. All of the sudden there are lights flashing all over the beach and the deafening roars of artillery cannons. There is a serene beauty about the scene as the beach lights up in fire and explosions. You are pulled out by your squad leader and storm forwards. After 3 hours the beach has been taken with the help of the brave paratroopers behind enemy lands. You are struck in the head as you walk around looking for ammo. You pass out.

echo You pilot a small tank and just landed on the beach. You fire at the bunkers, but your shells do no damage. Suddenly your tank gets struck by an artillery strike and everything goes black.
